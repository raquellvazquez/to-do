## What is To Do List?

[To do List](https://) is a project that allows you to add tasks to do, allowing you to select them when you finish said task or delete it if you want.

To do list shows you the current date so you can have a better planning of your pending tasks day by day.

In addition, To do list adapts to mobile and desktop devices so you can manage your tasks from any device you want.

## How does it work?

Add new task.

```
To add a new task, enter the name of the task in the "New task ..." input and click on the "+" icon.
```

```
In case you do not add a task and click on the add icon, a modal will appear with the legend "Please add new task", you only need to click on the "Ok" button for it to close.
```

List of Tasks

```
In this part the tasks are presented once you click on the "+" icon, showing you: the name of the task and a trash can icon that will allow you to delete the tasks one by one.

When you do not have tasks to do, the message "No task" will appear in the list and it will disappear as soon as you add your new task.
```

Select a task as finished.

```
Once you finish a task and want to mark it as finished, you only need to click on the name of the task and automatically the name will be crossed out in addition to changing the background color.

If by mistake you marked it as finished, you can click again on the name of the task and it will return to its initial state.
```

Delete a task

```
To delete a finished or to-do task, you only need to press the trash can icon and it will be removed from the task list.
```
